Process for generating test cert/key:
-------------------------------------
# NOT REQUIRED as I've included these files; just illustrating how they were created

openssl genrsa -out key.pem 4096

openssl req -new -sha256 -key key.pem -out csr.csr
# answered "." (leaves the field empty) for all fields except:
# CN=Test Cert
# For "extra" attributes, hit enter to leave password & company name blank

openssl req -x509 -sha256 -days 365 -key key.pem -in csr.csr -out cert.pem

openssl pkcs12 -export -out cert.p12 -inkey key.pem -in cert.pem
# used export password "test"



Load test cert/key into new NSSDB:
------------------------------------
# NOT REQUIRED as I've included these files; just illustrating how they were created

# create nssdb and load our test cert/key into it
export NSSDB=./.pki/nssdb
mkdir -p "$NSSDB"
certutil -d "sql:$NSSDB" -N --empty-password
pk12util -d "sql:$NSSDB" -i ./cert.p12 -W test

# confirm cert/key loaded into nssdb - should print "u,u,u" to show the key is accessible
certutil -d "sql:$NSSDB" -L -h all



To test using the cert in NSSDB:
------------------------------------
# (argument should be the directory where the .pki folder is)
./build*/minimal "$(pwd)"

# Result: client cert from NSSDB is used, onSelectClientCertificate is called, and mTLS succeeds



To test using an in-memory cert:
------------------------------------
./build*/minimal

# Result: cert is added to profile used by WebEngineView, but onSelectClientCertificate is never called, and mTLS fails
