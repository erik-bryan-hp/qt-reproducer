Process for generating test cert/key:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# NOT REQUIRED as I've included these files; just illustrating how they were created

openssl genrsa -out key.pem 4096

openssl req -new -sha256 -key key.pem -out csr.csr
# answered "." (leaves the field empty) for all fields except:
# CN=Test Cert
# For "extra" attributes, hit enter to leave password & company name blank

openssl req -x509 -sha256 -days 365 -key key.pem -in csr.csr -out cert.pem

openssl pkcs12 -export -out cert.p12 -inkey key.pem -in cert.pem
# used export password "test"



Load test cert/key into new NSSDB:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# NOT REQUIRED as I've included these files; just illustrating how they were created

# create nssdb and load our test cert/key into it
export NSSDB=./.pki/nssdb
mkdir -p "$NSSDB"
certutil -d "sql:$NSSDB" -N --empty-password
pk12util -d "sql:$NSSDB" -i ./cert.p12 -W test

# confirm cert/key loaded into nssdb - should print "u,u,u" to show the key is accessible
certutil -d "sql:$NSSDB" -L -h all



To test using the cert in the system store (NSSDB or Windows personal cert store):
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Linux: provide path to the directory containing the .pki folder however is most convenient
./minimal system /path/to/dir

# Windows: path isn't used - just give it any string to satisfy the check on number of args
#
# HOWEVER, you will first need to install cert.p12 to the current user's personal cert store.
# Steps to do this:
# - double click on cert.p12
# - choose Store Location: Current User
# - input password "test" when prompted
# - let it automatically choose the store
# - finish the wizard
#
# Confirm successful import by running certmgr.msc and looking under Personal/Certificates
minimal.exe system foo

# Result: client cert from NSSDB is used, onSelectClientCertificate is called, and mTLS succeeds



To test using the cert from the profile's in-memory cert store:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Linux: provide path to cert.p12 in whatever way is most convenient
./minimal profile /path/to/cert.p12

# Windows: provide path to cert.p12 in whatever way is most convenient
#
# HOWEVER, note that if you have previously added the test cert to your system cert store,
# you MUST remove it from the store first to properly exercise this path! I couldn't find
# any way to tell Qt/Chromium to ignore the system cert store, so it will always include the
# cert from the system store if you take this path, which defeats the purpose of the test.
# To remove the cert:
# - run certmgr.msc
# - delete "Test Cert" under Personal/Certificates
minimal.exe profile C:\path\to\cert.p12

# Result: cert is added to profile used by WebEngineView, but onSelectClientCertificate is never called, and mTLS fails
